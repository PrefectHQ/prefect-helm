## Deployment Configuration
worker:
  # -- unique cluster identifier, if none is provided this value will be infered at time of helm install
  clusterUid: ""

  image:
    # -- worker image repository
    repository: prefecthq/prefect
    ## prefect tag is pinned to the latest available image tag at packaging time.  Update the value here to
    ## override pinned tag
    # -- prefect image tag (immutable tags are recommended)
    prefectTag: 2-python3.11-kubernetes
    # -- worker image pull policy
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ## Optionally specify an array of imagePullSecrets.
    ## Secrets must be manually created in the namespace.
    ## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
    ## e.g:
    ## pullSecrets:
    ##   - myRegistryKeySecretName
    # -- worker image pull secrets
    pullSecrets: []
    # -- enable worker image debug mode
    debug: false

  ## general configuration of the worker
  config:
    # -- the work pool that your started worker will poll.

    # -- how often the worker will query for runs
    queryInterval: 5
    # -- when querying for runs, how many seconds in the future can they be scheduled

    # -- connect using HTTP/2 if the server supports it (experimental)
    http2: true
    # -- Maximum number of flow runs to start simultaneously (default: unlimited)
    limit: null
    ## You can set the worker type here.
    ## The default image includes only the type "kubernetes".
    ## Custom workers must be properly registered with the prefect cli.
